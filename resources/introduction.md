Team has a problem = A client wants a website to sell products.

What problem? The team wants to build new software (website) or adding new features or fixes to an existing one or develop something for a company.


In Scrum, the team breaks the problem into smaller chunks.

Example: Create an e-commerce website, we need (to-do list):
1. sign up page
2. login pages
3. list of products
4. payment methods
5. contact us
6. etc.


Product Backlog = to-do list 

This list is ordered,  the top has a higher priority than the work on the bottom.

### what Events happens using Scrum?
- Create the Product Backlog, Make the to-do list for the ecommerce => **Spring Planning**
- Execute the items on the Product Backlog, take. 1st pring we take item 1 y 2 => **Spring** 
- The team will notify the progress made each day, if something is finished, if there is a problem or if help from others is needed or if something is blocking a task from being completed. Keep focus in achieve the Spring => **Daily Scrum** 
- We finish a spring, and we show what we have achieved in that time  a **product** **Increment** is delivered and inspected. We have the sign-up and the login pages=> Spring Review
- As a team we value how we did when we were working as a team and we see how to improve next time => **Spring Restropective**


### Result of each event
 - Product Backlog 
 - Spring Backlog 
 - Increment 

### what is an Increment?
The new value that we add to the product, for example before we did not have the login page and now we do.
