### when are the Product Backlog items transformed into real value =>working products?"

During the Sprints.

We will talk about it later.

Is this it?

Not really.

We're not done yet.

For you to master Scrum, you need to understand the workflow.

In other words, how the outcome from a given Sprint influences future Sprints.

The results of the Sprint Review of the first Sprint can be used

to refine the Product Backlog.

Consequently, we will have an updated version of the Product

Backlog for the second Sprint.

So, this dashed line here represents that we have different

versions of the Product Backlog.

Over here is the version of the Product Backlog used as input for Sprint one.

And over here, we have a newly refined version of the Product

Backlog used as input for Sprint two.

And in Sprint two, of course, we still have the same Sprint structure.

We keep doing this until we are done.

Now, you must notice that this representation does not mean

that the Product Backlog can only be adapted, or refined, given

the results of a Sprint Review.

Product Backlog refinement is an ongoing process in which the Scrum

Team collaborates on the details of the Product Backlog items.

Still, we will get more into this later in this course.

For now, in our Scrum model, we will keep this representation just for simplicity.

In summary, we can visualize the Scrum flow as a sequence of rolling wave

plannings, in which each wave is a Sprint.

And, what do we do during a Sprint?

We start laying out the work to be done during the Sprint Planning.

Then, we transform the ideas into value by developing the product, reflecting on

our progress, and making this necessary adaptations during Daily Scrums.

Finally, we wrap it up with the Sprint Review, where we discuss the

product and Sprint Retrospective, where we discuss our ways of working.
