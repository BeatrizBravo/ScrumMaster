 
# Spring Events 
**The Sprint is a container for all other events**. Each event in Scrum is _a **formal** opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts. These events are specifically designed to enable the transparency required. Failure to operate any events as prescribed results in lost opportunities to inspect and adapt. **Events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum**._
## Sprint Planning.

The Product Owner must participate in the event having analyzed what needs to be done next and what should be the purpose of the Sprint.

The Product Owner must have a set of Product Backlog items and their mapping to the Product Goal.

The Product Owner might analyze questions such as which ideas and
assumptions need to be validated, which risks need to be addressed,
or, for instance, which functionality needs to be provided or enhanced.

Sprint =mini project,

The **Sprint Planning** event is when the Scrum Team defines the
goal of what to build and the flexible plan to guide achieving it.

The **plan** is called the **Sprint Backlog.**


## who participates in Sprint Planning?

The Scrum Team.

Further, the Scrum Team may invite others to attend to provide advice.

For instance, the candidate Product Backlog items might require working with a new technology that the Scrum Team does not have enough experience with.

Therefore, it might be a good idea for the Scrum Team to

invite a specialist to assist it.

## how do we execute the Sprint Planning?

The event has three topics to be addressed:

- **why** is this spring valuable?
- **what** can be done this sprint?
- **how** will the chosen work get done?


_**The Sprint Goal, the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog**._


This is **often** done by decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work items of one day or less (true)
(false => The work planned during Sprint Planning **must** be
decomposed to units of one day or less.)

Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually **shorter**.  => What is the time-box for the Spring Planning meeting for a 2-weeks sprint? = 8 hours or less.


_______


During Sprint Planning, the **whole Scrum Team** collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders.


## Spring Backlog
the **Sprint Backlog** is **composed** of:
- the Sprint Goal (**why**), (FIXED) [a commitment by the Developers]
- the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (**what**),(FLEXIBLE)
- as well as an **actionable plan** for delivering the Increment (**how**), (FLEXIBLE)

_The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers. It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal. Consequently, the Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned. It should have enough detail that they can inspect their progress in the Daily Scrum._



_Commitment:_ **Sprint Goal**
The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint. Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, **it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it**. The Sprint Goal also creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.

The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog. As the Developers work during the Sprint, they keep the Sprint Goal in mind. **If the work turns out to be different than they expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal.**



During a Sprint, the sales manager asks the Developers to add work on
something critical not part of the Sprint Backlog. What should they
=> Let the Product Owner aware so that he or she handles the requests of the sales manager.


  (False = _The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers.An output of the Sprint Planning is the Sprint Backlog,_ which consists of all the tasks to be   executed during the Sprint.
The second one part of the sentence (after the comma) is false, because the version of the Sprint Backlog immediately after the Sprint Planning is composed of a **few of the tasks** that **will be executed during the Sprint, not all of them**! 
  The Sprint Backlog emerges (is updated) during the Sprint as more is learned.

# Development work

## daily scrum 

1. what did I do yesterday that helped the team to meet the Sprint Goal?
2. what will I do today to help the team meet the Sprint Goal?
3. do I see any impediments that prevents me or the team from meeting the Sprint Goal?
The Developers set how to conduct the meeting.

The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to **inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary,** adjusting the upcoming planned work.

The Daily Scrum is a **15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team.** To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers.

The **Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want**, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an **actionable** **plan for the next day of work.** This creates focus and improves self-management.

Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.

The Daily Scrum **is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan.** They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprintâ€™s work.

## Spring Review

INSPECT the outcome of the sprint and determine future adaptations.
Time-boxed => 4 h for a monthly sprint; it is usually shorter for shorter sprints.

## Spring Restrospective


The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.

It is an opportunity for the scrum team to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.

3h for 1 moth spring

Goal to answer 3 questions:
- what went well during the sprint?
- what didn't go well?
- how can we improve?
