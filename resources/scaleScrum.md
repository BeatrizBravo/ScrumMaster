# The nexus guide

Multiple scrum team are working in one Product Backlog.
- one single product owner, can delegate
- 3 to 9 scrum team

## Increments must be produced?

- There must be one integrated Increment.


Because we still want to use the Increment as the reference for inspecting and adapting our path to develop the product.

- Scrum Teams don't need to be synchronized.They self-manage and define what is best for them.

challenge => dependencies => integration team, composed by:
  - one Product Owner, 
  - one Scrum Master, which might be a Scrum Master from the Scrum Teams,
  - the **Nexus integration team**, which might be members from the Scrum Teams.

Role of **resolving** dependencies and integration issues, making sure that the entire team is able to deliver the integrated Increment by the end of the Sprint.

Responsible:
- define the Definition of Done to be applied to the integrated Increment.

All Scrum Teams **must** adhere to this Definition of Done.

However, this **doesn't mean** that all Scrum Teams must **follow** the exactly same Definition of Done.
The Definition of Done for the integrated Increment is a minimum that the Scrum Teams must follow, and individual Scrum Teams may choose to apply a more stringent Definition of Done within their own teams.
