# Increment
##### increment = Definition of Done

# Definition of Done = Dof
"**formal description** of the state of the Increment when it
meets the **quality** measures required for the product. "

Set of **criteria** (gates):
* Quality Assurance
* Architecture
* Non-functional requirements
* Process management
* Configuration management



### Different of DoD and Acceptance criteria

#### Acceptance criteria
The Acceptance Criteria are specific for one user story, a single user story.
#### DoD
Definition of Done englobes all the Acceptance criteria.
<br>
Example, for a web app, one Definition of Done criteria could be that the pages must load in less than one second, given a decent internet connection.

This criteria in groups, all the Product Backlog items, or even the Increment, not any specific User Story.
## Who defines the Definition of Done?
- Organization
  - standards
  - conventions
  - guidelines
- External Standards
  - ISO 90000001
  - ISO 90000002
  - ISO 90000003
  - ISO 90000004

_If the Definition of Done for an increment **is part of** the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product._




(false = If the Definition of Done for an Increment is part of the convention standards or guidelines of the development organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it, and they're not allowed to adapt it => false because the Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum, They can adapt it by adding more stringent criteria.)
## When is the Definition of Done
The organization. If there is no the scrum team defined.

Spring is not a gate.

## Technical Debt
- Consequences of poor software development practices
- Might lead to code decay and architecture deterioration
- Scrum can manage it
- It is not necessaril bad


[_Technical debt is the **accumulation** of **suboptimal** or **incomplete** **solutions** in a software project that can **slow down the development process** and compromise the quality of the product._](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/what-best-practices-managing-technical-debt-scrum-projects#:~:text=Technical%20debt%20is%20the%20accumulation,the%20quality%20of%20the%20product.)
## The Increment
Done work, increase at the end of the spring, it doesn't need be release at the end.

1. You do not need to release at the end of every Sprint
2. The Sprint is not a gate;
   release might be performed during a Sprint
## Scrum Guide Reading
_The moment a Product Backlog item **meets the Definition of Done**, an Increment is **born**._

_If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product._
