- The PB is a living artifact
- PB items contain a despcription (no prescribed notiations)
- Usallyl, higher ordered (top) PB items are clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones (no a rule)
- An **emergent**, **ordered** list of **what is needed** to improve the product. Factor can be:
  - size
  - risk
  - value
  - dependencies

- The PO **orders** it considering whatever he/she judges as appropriate

### Desired base prioritization
Features as one of three categories:
##### Mandatory
Basic stuff.
<br>Its presence won't add
much value, but its absence has a
tremendous negative impact.
##### Linear
The more, the better. The more
linear features, the more
customers pay!
##### Exciter
Unknown desires

# PB Refinement
- Is the act of **breaking down** and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items.
- **Usually**, it is what enables getting the Product Backlog Items **Ready**
- The Scrum Team **decides** **how** and **when** refinement is done
# Definition of Ready DoR
* Acceptance criteria defined
* Team understands what has to be done
* Fits a sprint
# Monitoring Progress Toward Goals
### Burn-down
### Burn-uo
### Cumulative flow
