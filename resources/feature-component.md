Component Teams and Feature Teams.

A product that the user can interact with has features

A feature is a system behavior that fulfills some user needs. (something that the user can use)
A componet is a part of a system that **concentrates common functions** to implement features, which is a good **reuse**-driven software engineering practice. It might mean a system layer such as presentation, business, logic, and database, a software library or package, or a subsystem.

A feature could include work across all the components.

Featured teams are defined giving the product's features. A feature team works in all the necessary layers of the system and are capable of delivering end-to-end user value.

A component team focuses mainly on a specific component or a set of related components of the system.
Therefore frequently, a component team won't be able to deliver user value by itself.
