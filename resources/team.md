## Product Owner + Scrum master + developers = The Scrum Team = 1 + 1 + ? <= 10

Collectively, the Scrum Team is **responsible** **for all product-related a ctivities**, from stakeholder collaboration to research and development.


**Product Owner** = business person and takes care of the Product Backlog.

**Developers** = responsible for transforming the ideas reflected in the Product Backlog into Increments.

**Scrum Master** = makes Scrum run smoothly.


Entire Scrum Team = 
- **accountable** for creating a valuable, usable Increment every Sprint.
- **focused** on one objective at a time =>Product Goal
- **deal** with such **complexity** by poking the environment, checking how it responds, and **adapting** => by delivering products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback.
- **self-managed and cross-functional** => They define who does what, when, and how, and that it has all the skills needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the Scrum Team.
